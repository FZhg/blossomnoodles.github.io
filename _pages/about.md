## A word from Brayn
I guess I am an autodidact. I nearly spent all my college time on MIT OCW and other MOOC websites. I have learned 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, which is the three classic calculus classes covering multivariate calculus to differential equations, from MIT OpenCourseWare in my Freshman year. Then I finished 6.00, the introductory programming class by python in my first term of Sophomore. In the next term, I have completed 8.02 and 8.03, the introductory physics of electromagnetism and wave mechanics. Then I read through the Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffith and took my GRE in the beginning term of my Junior year. In the winter holiday of this term, I took a part-time job to be an English tutor at a local English tutoring company in my hometown. At the beginning of this semester, after I only took 3 lectures of Quantum Mechanics from the MIT OCW class 8.04, I bailed out. I discovered that physics is mighty as its subject the mother nature herself. To conduct physics experiment or even repeat the experiments other scholars have done, I had to move earth and heaven to realize it. There were so many impediments and so scarce my resources. That is how Machine Learning got into my horizon, like a new dawn chasing out all the darkness and desperation. 

I always have a kink for programming. Because I enjoy the way I can see the result almost immediately after I hit the build button. In physics, I am confined to discover the mechanism of how things work. But in programming, I learn the practice to create them, of course, in the digital world. 

I plan to apply for a graduate school of EECS. But I haven't published a paper yet. My transcript is a mess. I don't have a big corporation internship. I don't have a gorgeous recommendation letter. I only have an above 96% GRE scores. But like my mom said, "the car will always have a road to run." 

My families and friends are encouraging me all the time. My dad is a very funny and strong man. My mom is a very funny and strong woman. My friends are all charming in their own way. They are a little A-hole but charming. I love them so much. Give them my heart. Maybe they have taken up all my personal life. So I am still single and couldn't date a girl. I cross my finger for a successful date.

Right now, I am learning the open courses of Stanford CS299 by Andrew Ng and CS231n by Li Feifei. I am also studying the introductory algorithm class of MIT, the 6.006. Oh Boy! Just love the algorithm games! I figure it out that playing kaggle may impress the CS professors enough to give me an offer. 

In the end, whoever is reading, have fun!
