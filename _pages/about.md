## A word from Brayn
I guess I am a autodidact. I nearly spent all my college time on MIT ocw and other MOOC websites.I have learnt 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, which is the three classic calculus classes covering from multivariable calculus to diffrential equations, form MIT Opencourseware in my Freshman year. Then I finished 6.00, the introductory programming class by python in my first term of Sophomore. In the next term, I have completed 8.02 and 8.03, the introductory physics of electromagnetism and wave machanics. Then I read through the Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths and took my GRE in the beginning term of my Junior year. In the winter holiday of this term, I took a part time job to be an English tutor at a local English tutoring company in my home town. In the beigining of the this semaster, after I only took a 3 lectures of Quantum Machanics from the MIT OCW class 8.04, I bailed out. I discovered that physics is mighty as its subject the mother nature herself. To conduct physics experiment or even repeate the experiments other scholars have done, I had to move earth and heaven to realize it. There were so many impediments and so scarse my resources. That is how Machine Learning got into my horizon, like a new dawn chasing out all the darkness and disperation. 

I awalys have a kink for programming. Because I enjoy the way I can see the result al

My families and friends are encouraging me all the time. 

I am learning the open courses of Stanford CS299 by Andrew Ng and CS231n by Li Feifei.
