## A word from Brayn
I guess I am a autodidact. I nearly spent all my college time on MIT ocw and other MOOC websites.I have learnt 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, which is the three classic calculus classes covering from multivariable calculus to diffrential equations, form MIT Opencourseware in my Freshman year. Then I finished 6.00, the introductory programming class by python in my first term of Sophomore. In the next term, I have completed 8.02 and 8.03, the introductory physics of electromagnetism and wave machanics. Then I read through the Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths and took my GRE in the beginning term of my Junior year. In the winter holiday of this term, I took a part time job to be an English tutor at a local English tutoring company in my home town. In the beigining of the this semaster, after I only took a 3 lectures of Quantum Machanics from the MIT OCW class 8.04, I bailed out. I discovered that physics is mighty as its subject the mother nature herself. To conduct physics experiment or even repeate the experiments other scholars have done, I had to move earth and heaven to realize it. There were so many impediments and so scarse my resources. That is how Machine Learning got into my horizon, like a new dawn chasing out all the darkness and disperation. 

I awalys have a kink for programming. Because I enjoy the way I can see the result almost immediately after I hit the build button. In physcis I am confined to discover the machanism of how things work. But in programming, I learn the practice to create them, of course, in the digital world. 

I plan to apply for a graduate school of EECS. But I haven't publish a paper yet. My transcipt is a mess. I don't have a big copration internship. I don't have a gorgeous recommendation letter. I only have a above 96% GRE scores. But like my mom said, "the car will always have a road to run." 

My families and friends are encouraging me all the time. My dad is a very funny and strong man. My mon is a very funny and strong woman. My friends are all charming in their own way. They are a little A-hole but charming. I love them so much. Give them my heart. Maybe they have took up all my personal life. So I am still single and couldn't date a girl. I cross my finger for a successful date.

Right now, I am learning the open courses of Stanford CS299 by Andrew Ng and CS231n by Li Feifei. I am also studying the introductory algorithm class of MIT, the 6.006. Oh Boy! Just love the algorithm games! I figure it out that playing kaggle may  impress the CS professors enough to give me a offer. 

In the end, Enjoy your life, whoever is reading!
